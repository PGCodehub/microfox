To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the \"primary\" keyword.\nOptional query parameters\nmaxResults\tinteger\tMaximum number of entries returned on one result page. By default the value is 100 entries. The page size can never be larger than 250 entries. Optional.\npageToken\tstring\tToken specifying which result page to return. Optional.\nshowDeleted\tboolean\tWhether to include deleted ACLs in the result. Deleted ACLs are represented by role equal to \"none\". Deleted ACLs will always be included if syncToken is provided. Optional. The default is False.\nsyncToken\tstring\tToken obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All entries deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False.\nIf the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken.\nLearn more about incremental synchronization.\nOptional.
