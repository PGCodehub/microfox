It is used to uniquely identify events accross calendaring systems and must be supplied when importing events via the import method.\n\nNote that the iCalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same iCalUIDs.

To minimize the risk of collisions we recommend using an established UUID algorithm such as one described in RFC4122.\n\nIf you do not specify an ID, it will be automatically generated by the server.\n\nNote that the icalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time.

The URL scheme must be HTTP or HTTPS.\twritable\nstart\tnested object\tThe (inclusive) start time of the event. For a recurring event, this is the start time of the first instance.\t\nstart.date\tdate\tThe date, in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd\", if this is an all-day event.\twritable\nstart.dateTime\tdatetime\tThe time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.\twritable\nstart.timeZone\tstring\tThe time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. \"Europe/Zurich\".) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\twritable\nstatus\tstring\tStatus of the event. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"confirmed\" - The event is confirmed. This is the default status.\n\"tentative\" - The event is tentatively confirmed.\n\"cancelled\" - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\n\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:\n\nCancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\n\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.\n\nAll other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\n\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.\n\nOn the organizer's calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\n\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.\n\n\twritable\nsummary\tstring\tTitle of the event.\twritable\ntransparency\tstring\tWhether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"opaque\" - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI.\n\"transparent\" - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.\n\twritable\nupdated\tdatetime\tLast modification time of the main event data (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Updating event reminders will not cause this to change. Read-only.\t\nvisibility\tstring\tVisibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"default\" - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value.\n\"public\" - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.\n\"private\" - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.\n\"confidential\" - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.\n\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties\tnested object\tWorking location event data.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.customLocation\tobject\tIf present, specifies that the user is working from a custom location.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.customLocation.label\tstring\tAn optional extra label for additional information.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.homeOffice\tany value\tIf present, specifies that the user is working at home.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation\tobject\tIf present, specifies that the user is working from an office.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.buildingId\tstring\tAn optional building identifier. This should reference a building ID in the organization's Resources database.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.deskId\tstring\tAn optional desk identifier.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.floorId\tstring\tAn optional floor identifier.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.floorSectionId\tstring\tAn optional floor section identifier.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.label\tstring\tThe office name that's displayed in Calendar Web and Mobile clients. We recommend you reference a building name in the organization's Resources database.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.type\tstring\tType of the working location. Possible values are:\n\"homeOffice\" - The user is working at home.\n\"officeLocation\" - The user is working from an office.\n\"customLocation\" - The user is working from a custom location.\nAny details are specified in a sub-field of the specified name, but this field may be missing if empty. Any other fields are ignored.\n\nRequired when adding working location properties.\n\n\twritable\nMethods\ndelete\nDeletes an event.\nget\nReturns an event based on its Google Calendar ID. To retrieve an event using its iCalendar ID, call the events.list method using the iCalUID parameter.\nimport\nImports an event. This operation is used to add a private copy of an existing event to a calendar. Only events with an eventType of default may be imported.\n\nDeprecated behavior: If a non-default event is imported, its type will be changed to default and any event-type-specific properties it may have will be dropped.\n\ninsert\nCreates an event.\ninstances\nReturns instances of the specified recurring event.\nlist\nReturns events on the specified calendar.\nmove\nMoves an event to another calendar, i.e. changes an event's organizer. Note that only default events can be moved; birthday, focusTime, fromGmail, outOfOffice and workingLocation events cannot be moved.\npatch\nUpdates an event. This method supports patch semantics. Note that each patch request consumes three quota units; prefer using a get followed by an update. The field values you specify replace the existing values. Fields that you don't specify in the request remain unchanged. Array fields, if specified, overwrite the existing arrays; this discards any previous array elements.\nquickAdd\nCreates an event based on a simple text string.\nupdate\nUpdates an event. This method does not support patch semantics and always updates the entire event resource. To do a partial update, perform a get followed by an update using etags to ensure atomicity.\nwatch\nWatch for changes to Events resources.\nWas this helpful?\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
