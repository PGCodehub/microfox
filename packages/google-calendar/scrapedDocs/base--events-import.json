This operation is used to add a private copy of an existing event to a calendar. Only events with an eventType of default may be imported.\n\nDeprecated behavior: If a non-default event is imported, its type will be changed to default and any event-type-specific properties it may have will be dropped.\n\nTry it now or see an example.\n\nRequest\nHTTP request\nPOST https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/calendarId/events/import\nParameters\nParameter name\tValue\tDescription\nPath parameters\ncalendarId\tstring\tCalendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the \"primary\" keyword.\nOptional query parameters\nconferenceDataVersion\tinteger\tVersion number of conference data supported by the API client. Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event's body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0. Acceptable values are 0 to 1, inclusive.\nsupportsAttachments\tboolean\tWhether API client performing operation supports event attachments. Optional. The default is False.\nAuthorization\n\nThis request requires authorization with at least one of the following scopes:\n\nScope\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.app.created\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.owned\n\nFor more information, see the authentication and authorization page.\n\nRequest body\n\nIn the request body, supply an Events resource with the following properties:\n\nProperty name\tValue\tDescription\tNotes\nRequired Properties\nend\tnested object\tThe (exclusive) end time of the event. For a recurring event, this is the end time of the first instance.\t\niCalUID\tstring\tEvent unique identifier as defined in RFC5545. It is used to uniquely identify events accross calendaring systems and must be supplied when importing events via the import method.\n\nNote that the iCalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same iCalUIDs. To retrieve an event using its iCalUID, call the events.list method using the iCalUID parameter. To retrieve an event using its id, call the events.get method.\n\n\t\nstart\tnested object\tThe (inclusive) start time of the event. For a recurring event, this is the start time of the first instance.\t\nOptional Properties\nanyoneCanAddSelf\tboolean\tWhether anyone can invite themselves to the event (deprecated). Optional. The default is False.\twritable\nattachments[].fileUrl\tstring\tURL link to the attachment.\n\nFor adding Google Drive file attachments use the same format as in alternateLink property of the Files resource in the Drive API.\n\nRequired when adding an attachment.\n\n\twritable\nattendees[]\tlist\tThe attendees of the event. See the Events with attendees guide for more information on scheduling events with other calendar users.

The default is False.\twritable\nattendees[].resource\tboolean\tWhether the attendee is a resource. Can only be set when the attendee is added to the event for the first time. Subsequent modifications are ignored. Optional. The default is False.\twritable\nattendees[].responseStatus\tstring\tThe attendee's response status. Possible values are:\n\"needsAction\" - The attendee has not responded to the invitation (recommended for new events).\n\"declined\" - The attendee has declined the invitation.\n\"tentative\" - The attendee has tentatively accepted the invitation.\n\"accepted\" - The attendee has accepted the invitation.\nWarning: If you add an event using the values declined, tentative, or accepted, attendees with the \"Add invitations to my calendar\" setting set to \"When I respond to invitation in email\" or \"Only if the sender is known\" might have their response reset to needsAction and won't see an event in their calendar unless they change their response in the event invitation email. Furthermore, if more than 200 guests are invited to the event, response status is not propagated to the guests.\n\twritable\nattendeesOmitted\tboolean\tWhether attendees may have been omitted from the event's representation. When retrieving an event, this may be due to a restriction specified by the maxAttendee query parameter. When updating an event, this can be used to only update the participant's response. Optional. The default is False.\twritable\ncolorId\tstring\tThe color of the event. This is an ID referring to an entry in the event section of the colors definition (see the colors endpoint). Optional.\twritable\nconferenceData\tnested object\tThe conference-related information, such as details of a Google Meet conference. To create new conference details use the createRequest field.

If the organizer is also an attendee, this is indicated with a separate entry in attendees with the organizer field set to True. To change the organizer, use the move operation. Read-only, except when importing an event.\twritable\norganizer.displayName\tstring\tThe organizer's name, if available.\twritable\norganizer.email\tstring\tThe organizer's email address, if available. It must be a valid email address as per RFC5322.\twritable\noriginalStartTime.date\tdate\tThe date, in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd\", if this is an all-day event.\twritable\noriginalStartTime.dateTime\tdatetime\tThe time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339).

(Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. \"Europe/Zurich\".) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\twritable\noutOfOfficeProperties\tnested object\tOut of office event data. Used if eventType is outOfOffice.\twritable\nrecurrence[]\tlist\tList of RRULE, EXRULE, RDATE and EXDATE lines for a recurring event, as specified in RFC5545. Note that DTSTART and DTEND lines are not allowed in this field; event start and end times are specified in the start and end fields. This field is omitted for single events or instances of recurring events.\twritable\nreminders.overrides[]\tlist\tIf the event doesn't use the default reminders, this lists the reminders specific to the event, or, if not set, indicates that no reminders are set for this event. The maximum number of override reminders is 5.\twritable\nreminders.overrides[].method\tstring\tThe method used by this reminder. Possible values are:\n\"email\" - Reminders are sent via email.\n\"popup\" - Reminders are sent via a UI popup.\n\nRequired when adding a reminder.\n\n\twritable\nreminders.overrides[].minutes\tinteger\tNumber of minutes before the start of the event when the reminder should trigger.

Possible values are:\n\"confirmed\" - The event is confirmed. This is the default status.\n\"tentative\" - The event is tentatively confirmed.\n\"cancelled\" - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\n\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:\n\nCancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\n\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.\n\nAll other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\n\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.\n\nOn the organizer's calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\n\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.\n\n\twritable\nsummary\tstring\tTitle of the event.\twritable\ntransparency\tstring\tWhether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"opaque\" - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI.\n\"transparent\" - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.\n\twritable\nvisibility\tstring\tVisibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"default\" - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value.\n\"public\" - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.\n\"private\" - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.\n\"confidential\" - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.\n\twritable\nResponse\n\nIf successful, this method returns an Events resource in the response body.\n\nExamples\n\nNote: The code examples available for this method do not represent all supported programming languages (see the client libraries page for a list of supported languages).\n\nJava\nPython\nPHP\nRuby\n\nUses the Java client library.\n\nimport com.google.api.services.calendar.Calendar;\nimport com.google.api.services.calendar.model.Event;\nimport com.google.api.services.calendar.model.EventAttendee;\nimport com.google.api.services.calendar.model.EventDateTime;\nimport com.google.api.client.util.DateTime;\n\nimport java.util.Date;\n// ...\n\n// Initialize Calendar service with valid OAuth credentials\nCalendar service = new Calendar.Builder(httpTransport, jsonFactory, credentials)\n    .setApplicationName(\"applicationName\").build();\n\n// Create and initialize a new event (could also retrieve an existing event)\nEvent event = new Event();\nevent.setICalUID(\"originalUID\");\n\nEvent.Organizer organizer = new Event.Organizer();\norganizer.setEmail(\"organizerEmail\");\norganizer.setDisplayName(\"organizerDisplayName\");\nevent.setOrganizer(organizer);\n\nArrayList<EventAttendee> attendees = new ArrayList<EventAttendee>();\nattendees.add(new EventAttendee().setEmail(\"attendeeEmail\"));\n// ...\nevent.setAttendees(attendees);\n\nDate startDate = new Date();\nDate endDate = new Date(startDate.getTime() + 3600000);\nDateTime start = new DateTime(startDate, TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"UTC\"));\nevent.setStart(new EventDateTime().setDateTime(start));\nDateTime end = new DateTime(endDate, TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"UTC\"));\nevent.setEnd(new EventDateTime().setDateTime(end));\n\n// Import the event into a calendar\nEvent importedEvent = service.events().calendarImport('primary', event).execute();\n\nSystem.out.println(importedEvent.getId());\nWas this helpful?\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
