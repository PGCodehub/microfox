Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event's body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0. Acceptable values are 0 to 1, inclusive.\nmaxAttendees\tinteger\tThe maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.\nsendNotifications\tboolean\tDeprecated.

The default is false.\n\nAcceptable values are:\n\"all\": Notifications are sent to all guests.\n\"externalOnly\": Notifications are sent to non-Google Calendar guests only.\n\"none\": No notifications are sent.\nWarning: Using the value none can have significant adverse effects, including events not syncing to external calendars or events being lost altogether for some users. For calendar migration tasks, consider using the events.import method instead.\n\nsupportsAttachments\tboolean\tWhether API client performing operation supports event attachments. Optional. The default is False.\nAuthorization\n\nThis request requires authorization with at least one of the following scopes:\n\nScope\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.app.created\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.owned\n\nFor more information, see the authentication and authorization page.\n\nRequest body\n\nIn the request body, supply an Events resource with the following properties:\n\nProperty name\tValue\tDescription\tNotes\nRequired Properties\nend\tnested object\tThe (exclusive) end time of the event.

Cannot have a contact.\nThe Calendar API only supports creating events with the type \"birthday\". The type cannot be changed after the event is created.\twritable\ncolorId\tstring\tThe color of the event. This is an ID referring to an entry in the event section of the colors definition (see the colors endpoint). Optional.\twritable\nconferenceData\tnested object\tThe conference-related information, such as details of a Google Meet conference. To create new conference details use the createRequest field. To persist your changes, remember to set the conferenceDataVersion request parameter to 1 for all event modification requests.\twritable\ndescription\tstring\tDescription of the event. Can contain HTML. Optional.\twritable\nend.date\tdate\tThe date, in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd\", if this is an all-day event.\twritable\nend.dateTime\tdatetime\tThe time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.\twritable\nend.timeZone\tstring\tThe time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. \"Europe/Zurich\".) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\twritable\neventType\tstring\tSpecific type of the event.

The default is True.\twritable\nid\tstring\tOpaque identifier of the event. When creating new single or recurring events, you can specify their IDs. Provided IDs must follow these rules:\ncharacters allowed in the ID are those used in base32hex encoding, i.e. lowercase letters a-v and digits 0-9, see section 3.1.2 in RFC2938\nthe length of the ID must be between 5 and 1024 characters\nthe ID must be unique per calendar\nDue to the globally distributed nature of the system, we cannot guarantee that ID collisions will be detected at event creation time. To minimize the risk of collisions we recommend using an established UUID algorithm such as one described in RFC4122.\n\nIf you do not specify an ID, it will be automatically generated by the server.\n\nNote that the icalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same icalUIDs.\n\n\twritable\nlocation\tstring\tGeographic location of the event as free-form text. Optional.\twritable\noriginalStartTime.date\tdate\tThe date, in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd\", if this is an all-day event.\twritable\noriginalStartTime.dateTime\tdatetime\tThe time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.\twritable\noriginalStartTime.timeZone\tstring\tThe time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. \"Europe/Zurich\".) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\twritable\noutOfOfficeProperties\tnested object\tOut of office event data. Used if eventType is outOfOffice.\twritable\nrecurrence[]\tlist\tList of RRULE, EXRULE, RDATE and EXDATE lines for a recurring event, as specified in RFC5545. Note that DTSTART and DTEND lines are not allowed in this field; event start and end times are specified in the start and end fields. This field is omitted for single events or instances of recurring events.\twritable\nreminders.overrides[]\tlist\tIf the event doesn't use the default reminders, this lists the reminders specific to the event, or, if not set, indicates that no reminders are set for this event. The maximum number of override reminders is 5.\twritable\nreminders.overrides[].method\tstring\tThe method used by this reminder. Possible values are:\n\"email\" - Reminders are sent via email.\n\"popup\" - Reminders are sent via a UI popup.\n\nRequired when adding a reminder.\n\n\twritable\nreminders.overrides[].minutes\tinteger\tNumber of minutes before the start of the event when the reminder should trigger. Valid values are between 0 and 40320 (4 weeks in minutes).\n\nRequired when adding a reminder.\n\n\twritable\nreminders.useDefault\tboolean\tWhether the default reminders of the calendar apply to the event.\twritable\nsequence\tinteger\tSequence number as per iCalendar.\twritable\nsource.title\tstring\tTitle of the source; for example a title of a web page or an email subject.\twritable\nsource.url\tstring\tURL of the source pointing to a resource. The URL scheme must be HTTP or HTTPS.\twritable\nstart.date\tdate\tThe date, in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd\", if this is an all-day event.\twritable\nstart.dateTime\tdatetime\tThe time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.\twritable\nstart.timeZone\tstring\tThe time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. \"Europe/Zurich\".) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\twritable\nstatus\tstring\tStatus of the event. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"confirmed\" - The event is confirmed. This is the default status.\n\"tentative\" - The event is tentatively confirmed.\n\"cancelled\" - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\n\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:\n\nCancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\n\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.\n\nAll other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\n\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.\n\nOn the organizer's calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\n\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.\n\n\twritable\nsummary\tstring\tTitle of the event.\twritable\ntransparency\tstring\tWhether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"opaque\" - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI.\n\"transparent\" - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.\n\twritable\nvisibility\tstring\tVisibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"default\" - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value.\n\"public\" - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.\n\"private\" - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.\n\"confidential\" - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.\n\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties\tnested object\tWorking location event data.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.customLocation\tobject\tIf present, specifies that the user is working from a custom location.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.customLocation.label\tstring\tAn optional extra label for additional information.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.homeOffice\tany value\tIf present, specifies that the user is working at home.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation\tobject\tIf present, specifies that the user is working from an office.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.buildingId\tstring\tAn optional building identifier. This should reference a building ID in the organization's Resources database.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.deskId\tstring\tAn optional desk identifier.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.floorId\tstring\tAn optional floor identifier.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.floorSectionId\tstring\tAn optional floor section identifier.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.label\tstring\tThe office name that's displayed in Calendar Web and Mobile clients. We recommend you reference a building name in the organization's Resources database.\twritable\nworkingLocationProperties.type\tstring\tType of the working location. Possible values are:\n\"homeOffice\" - The user is working at home.\n\"officeLocation\" - The user is working from an office.\n\"customLocation\" - The user is working from a custom location.\nAny details are specified in a sub-field of the specified name, but this field may be missing if empty. Any other fields are ignored.\n\nRequired when adding working location properties.\n\n\twritable\nResponse\n\nIf successful, this method returns an Events resource in the response body.\n\nExamples\n\nNote: The code examples available for this method do not represent all supported programming languages (see the client libraries page for a list of supported languages).\n\nJava\nPython\nPHP\nRuby\n.NET\nGo\nJavaScript\nNode.js\n\nUses the Java client library.\n\n// Refer to the Java quickstart on how to setup the environment:\n// https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/quickstart/java\n// Change the scope to CalendarScopes.CALENDAR and delete any stored\n// credentials.\n\nEvent event = new Event()\n    .setSummary(\"Google I/O 2015\")\n    .setLocation(\"800 Howard St., San Francisco, CA 94103\")\n    .setDescription(\"A chance to hear more about Google's developer products.\");\n\nDateTime startDateTime = new DateTime(\"2015-05-28T09:00:00-07:00\");\nEventDateTime start = new EventDateTime()\n    .setDateTime(startDateTime)\n    .setTimeZone(\"America/Los_Angeles\");\nevent.setStart(start);\n\nDateTime endDateTime = new DateTime(\"2015-05-28T17:00:00-07:00\");\nEventDateTime end = new EventDateTime()\n    .setDateTime(endDateTime)\n    .setTimeZone(\"America/Los_Angeles\");\nevent.setEnd(end);\n\nString[] recurrence = new String[] {\"RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=2\"};\nevent.setRecurrence(Arrays.asList(recurrence));\n\nEventAttendee[] attendees = new EventAttendee[] {\n    new EventAttendee().setEmail(\"lpage@example.com\"),\n    new EventAttendee().setEmail(\"sbrin@example.com\"),\n};\nevent.setAttendees(Arrays.asList(attendees));\n\nEventReminder[] reminderOverrides = new EventReminder[] {\n    new EventReminder().setMethod(\"email\").setMinutes(24 * 60),\n    new EventReminder().setMethod(\"popup\").setMinutes(10),\n};\nEvent.Reminders reminders = new Event.Reminders()\n    .setUseDefault(false)\n    .setOverrides(Arrays.asList(reminderOverrides));\nevent.setReminders(reminders);\n\nString calendarId = \"primary\";\nevent = service.events().insert(calendarId, event).execute();\nSystem.out.printf(\"Event created: %s\\n\", event.getHtmlLink());\nWas this helpful?\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
