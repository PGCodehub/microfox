This method supports patch semantics. Note that each patch request consumes three quota units; prefer using a get followed by an update. The field values you specify replace the existing values. Fields that you don't specify in the request remain unchanged. Array fields, if specified, overwrite the existing arrays; this discards any previous array elements. Try it now.\n\nRequest\nHTTP request\nPATCH https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/calendarId/events/eventId\nParameters\nParameter name\tValue\tDescription\nPath parameters\ncalendarId\tstring\tCalendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the \"primary\" keyword.\neventId\tstring\tEvent identifier.\nOptional query parameters\nalwaysIncludeEmail\tboolean\tDeprecated and ignored. A value will always be returned in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email address is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided).\nconferenceDataVersion\tinteger\tVersion number of conference data supported by the API client. Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event's body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0. Acceptable values are 0 to 1, inclusive.\nmaxAttendees\tinteger\tThe maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.\nsendNotifications\tboolean\tDeprecated.

Note that some emails might still be sent even if you set the value to false. The default is false.\nsendUpdates\tstring\tGuests who should receive notifications about the event update (for example, title changes, etc.).\n\nAcceptable values are:\n\"all\": Notifications are sent to all guests.\n\"externalOnly\": Notifications are sent to non-Google Calendar guests only.\n\"none\": No notifications are sent. For calendar migration tasks, consider using the Events.import method instead.\n\nsupportsAttachments\tboolean\tWhether API client performing operation supports event attachments. Optional. The default is False.\nAuthorization\n\nThis request requires authorization with at least one of the following scopes:\n\nScope\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.app.created\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.owned\n\nFor more information, see the authentication and authorization page.\n\nRequest body\n\nIn the request body, supply the relevant portions of an Events resource, according to the rules of patch semantics.\n\nResponse\n\nIf successful, this method returns an Events resource in the response body.\n\nWas this helpful?\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
