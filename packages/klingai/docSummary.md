## Kling AI API - TypeScript SDK Summary

This summary outlines the Kling AI API based on the provided documentation, focusing on the technical details required for TypeScript SDK implementation.  The documentation primarily focuses on announcing a new system launch and doesn't provide specific API endpoint details.  Therefore, this summary serves as a placeholder and needs to be updated once the actual API documentation for the new system becomes available.

**Key Information:**

* **New System Launch:** A new API system launched on May 22, 2025 (UTC+8).  The new API base URL is `https://api-singapore.klingai.com`.
* **Existing Users:** Users with API purchases before May 22, 2025, will be migrated to the new system in June 2025.
* **New Users:** Users without prior API purchases must use the new system and its documentation.
* **Missing API Documentation:** The provided documentation lacks specific details on API endpoints, request/response formats, authentication, etc. This summary will need to be updated when that information is released.


**Placeholder API Endpoints (To be updated with actual API documentation):**

The following are placeholder endpoints based on the mentioned Kling AI capabilities.  These need to be confirmed and detailed when the official API documentation is released.

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Authentication | Request Parameters | Request Body | Response | Edge Cases |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/text-to-video` | `POST` | Generates a video from text prompt. |  `TBD` (Likely API Key or OAuth) | `prompt` (string, required), `style` (string, optional),  `duration` (number, optional) |  `TBD` | `TBD` (Likely a video URL or ID) |  Prompt length limitations, rate limiting. |
| `/image-to-video` | `POST` | Generates a video from an image. | `TBD` | `image_url` (string, required), `style` (string, optional), `duration` (number, optional) | `TBD` | `TBD` | Image size/format restrictions, rate limiting. |
| `/multi-image-to-video` | `POST` | Generates a video from multiple images. | `TBD` | `image_urls` (array of strings, required), `style` (string, optional), `duration` (number, optional) | `TBD` | `TBD` | Maximum number of images, image size/format restrictions, rate limiting. |
| `/video-extension` | `POST` | Extends the duration of a video. | `TBD` | `video_url` (string, required), `duration` (number, required) | `TBD` | `TBD` |  Video format restrictions, maximum extension duration, rate limiting. |
| `/lip-sync` | `POST` | Synchronizes lip movements in a video with provided audio. | `TBD` | `video_url` (string, required), `audio_url` (string, required) | `TBD` | `TBD` | Video and audio format restrictions, duration limitations, rate limiting. |
| `/video-effects` | `POST` | Applies special effects to a video. | `TBD` | `video_url` (string, required), `effect_name` (string, required) | `TBD` | `TBD` | Supported effect names, video format restrictions, rate limiting. |
| `/image-generation` | `POST` | Generates an image from a text prompt. | `TBD` | `prompt` (string, required), `style` (string, optional) | `TBD` | `TBD` (Likely an image URL or ID) | Prompt length limitations, rate limiting. |
| `/virtual-try-on` | `POST` |  Applies virtual try-on of clothing or accessories to an image or video.  | `TBD` | `image_url` or `video_url` (string, required), `item_id` (string, required) | `TBD` | `TBD` | Supported item IDs, image/video format restrictions, rate limiting. |
| `/account-information` | `GET` | Retrieves account information, likely including billing details and usage. | `TBD` |  `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` (JSON with account details) | Rate limiting. |
| `/billing` | `GET` | Retrieves billing information. | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` (JSON with billing details) | Rate limiting. |


**Authentication (TBD):**

The authentication method is not specified.  It is likely to be API Key based or OAuth 2.0.  This needs to be confirmed when the official API documentation is available.

**Response Formats (TBD):**

The response formats are not specified.  They are likely to be JSON for most endpoints, potentially returning URLs or IDs for generated media.  This needs to be confirmed.

**TypeScript SDK Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The SDK should include robust error handling for API requests, including network errors, rate limiting, and API-specific errors.
* **Types:**  Precise TypeScript types should be defined for all request parameters, request bodies, and response data.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** API calls should be handled asynchronously using Promises or Async/Await.
* **Modularity:** The SDK should be designed in a modular way to allow easy integration and maintenance.


This summary provides a starting point for building a TypeScript SDK for the Kling AI API.  It is crucial to update this information with the official documentation when it becomes available.  The placeholder endpoints and assumptions made here need to be verified and replaced with accurate details.
