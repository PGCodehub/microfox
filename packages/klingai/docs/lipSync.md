  - **`audioUrl`** (string, required): The publicly accessible URL of the audio file to sync with the video.

**Return Value:**

const taskId = await klingai.lipSync({
  videoUrl: 'https://example.com/path/to/your/video-of-person.mp4',
  audioUrl: 'https://example.com/path/to/your/audio-narration.mp3'
